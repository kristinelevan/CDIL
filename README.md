CDIL Summer Projects
Goals for CDIL projects: 
1.) Find way(s) to visually present Pokemon interview data (specifically regarding race, ethnicity, gender and differential playing experiences) with respect to the idea of "othering" 
2.) Consider ways to have students present interview data from their personal practitioner projects in the Gender and Crime course. This is the assignment 
prompt I have used in the past:
Choose one female practitioners that works in the Criminal Justice systems to interview. This may be a female police officer, attorney, correctional officer, probation or parole officer, judge, victim service advocate, etc. (If you have questions as to whether someone’s job would be classified as working within the CJ system, please ask). Create open ended interview questions (approximately 5-7 questions) that address issues related to her job and, specifically, the gender perspective. (I am open to what questions you ask, as long as they are appropriate, capture the uniqueness of gender, and relate to her experiences in her position of employment – if you would like for me to review your questions ahead of time, please let me know.)
Please make sure you also let them know this is for a class assignment and that you will be sharing their answers with your peers and instructor.
For this blog post, make sure you note who you interviewed, their employment position, and the date of the interview. Transcribe your interview here for your classmates to read.
